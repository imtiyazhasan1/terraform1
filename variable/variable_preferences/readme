This file is created to understand the preferences which terraform follows

#Env Variable override variable define under variable.tf


#terraform.tfvars variable override Environment variable and variable.tf

#-var values passing the variable during run time override variable.rf, Env Variable and terraform.tfvars

#-var 1 and -var 2 pass the SAME variable during run time then last -var values will be considered.

#There is another way to place the variable under *.auto.tfvars file. If variable defines under this and also defines under terraform.tfvars then *.auto.tfvars file will override terraform.tfvars variable

#if there are two files *.auto.tfvars which contains the same variable then value of that variable will be considered which was defined under oldest file.
